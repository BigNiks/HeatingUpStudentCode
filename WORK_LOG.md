My first thought is to find the lowest number in the array, then check for the next biggest number and so on. |
| Jan 15 | 8:55 = 9:55 AM | So I was correct in thinking about approaching this recursively. I spend the first half an hour or so thinking out a possible solution, my first idea was the find the lowest number, and then call the recursive function to detect whether or not a number should be skipped. Mr. Blick told me about a different method in which I start with the largest number and make my way to the left instead of right. |

Although my code isn't correct yet, I feel as if it is a step in the right direction. But for now, I have a strong foundation of what I am going to build my code off of. |
